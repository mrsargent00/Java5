# Java5

## Description
The first attempt at the code, I was going in the right direction, I was almost done in fact. The code flowed well, worked right, but never displayed on the website as the correct thing. Inspect kept telling me that there was something wrong with my HTML, and my heart sank, I had to start over. And like the goober that I am, I didn't copy my code over to the new repository that I created. So I had to do it all over again, I forgot how to do majority of what I did, so I had to use links to refresh my memory. It is a password generator with 24 characters.


## Installation

First, I copied the entire code from the homework folder that we had to do, then completely messed up the copying of it all over. So half way through writing my code, I forgot to copy it all over to the new folder that was made, and had to restart over. Now it is deployed as a website that generates randomly generated passwords including:
Upper case
Lower case
Numbers
Special Characters.

Just hit Generate!
